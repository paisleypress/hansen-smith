                            <li>Can you see your own doctor the same day you call for an appointment?</li>
                            <li>Is your wait typically less than 5 minutes in the lobby?</li>
                            <li>Are you satisfied with the amount of time your doctor spends with you?</li>
                            <li>Does your doctor really listen to you?</li>
                            <li>Do you have direct access to your own doctor outside of office hours?</li>
                            <li>If you answered “No” to any of these questions, then you are like so many others who are frustrated with today’s healthcare industry.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br>
                        <p>Hansen-Smith Family Medicine has a limit on the total number of patients in the practice, so you will not compete with thousands of other patients for the doctor’s time.
                        At Hansen-Smith Family Medicine, you can be seen by Dr. Karen Hansen-Smith the same day you call for your appointment—no more waiting weeks for an opening or for hours in the
                        lobby, and no substitute healthcare practitioners. Everyone’s time is valuable, so we schedule patients with enough time to deal with all of their concerns, and enough time
                        between patients to significantly reduce waiting times in the office.  Most patients are guided directly to the exam room without even stopping in the lobby.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Dr. Karen Hansen-Smith believes that listening is the most important thing a good doctor must do.  She listens to all of your concerns and explains her diagnostic decisions
                        and your treatment choices—making you a partner in your own healthcare.  When you leave her office, you will know that you have really been heard. All of Dr. Hansen-Smith’s
                        patients have direct access to her all of the time.  You do not have to deal with other doctors “on call” or rely on “urgent care clinics” to be treated outside of office hours.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>This unique practice will provide you with the kind of compassion, dignity and respect we all deserve.

                        <h4 class="sectionHeader">How Do We Do It?</h4>
                        <p>Everyone would like to have an old-fashioned relationship with their doctor along with the benefits of modern medicine.</p>
                        <p>Hansen-Smith Family Medicine offers the best of both worlds--your doctor available to you when you need her with time to listen and the skills to diagnose
                        and treat your medical concerns.</p>
                        <p>Most doctors rely on the insurance companies to pay for their services to patients; but insurance companies are paying less and less, so doctors have to
                        see more and more patients just to cover their office expenses.  Most family physicians maintain at least 2,500 patients, seeing 35 to 45 patients a day,
                        and this limits the amount of time and attention given to each person.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Personal Medicine (also called “concierge” or “boutique medicine”) uses a retainer fee, paid annually by each patient to allow the doctor to keep her
                        practice limited to 600 patients. With less than one-fourth the usual number of patients, Dr. Hansen-Smith is able to spend more time at each visit to
                        allow all concerns to be addressed.</p>
                        <p>The Annual Enrollment Fee is not a covered benefit under any insurance company, so insurance companies will not pay for the fee—it is the sole
                        responsibility of the patient.</p>
                        <p>The enrollment fee allows the patient to have less competition from other patients for the doctor’s time and energy, and does not replace health insurance.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h4 class="sectionHeader">Annual Enrollment Fee</h4>
                        <p>The patient’s annual enrollment fee is paid in advance, starting the day the agreement is signed. This may be paid yearly or in installments
                        (for example, once a month, every two months or every six months).
                        <br>

                        responsibility of the patient.</p>
                        <p>The fee may change with advance notice to the patient.</p>

                        <p>Patients with Medicare are accepted. The Annual Enrollment Fee is not covered by Medicare. Those enrolling prior to age 65 will not have their
                        fee increased when they reach age 65.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h4 class="sectionHeader">Payment Policies:</h4>
                        <p>Members of Hansen-Smith Family Medicine have full access to the doctor from the day they register with the practice--whether they are seen by
                        the doctor or not. Payment of the fee is expected from all patients--whether or not they contact or are seen by the doctor.</p>
                        <p>Initial payment is due upon registering in the practice and can be paid with check, cash or credit card (Visa, MasterCard, American Express and
                        Discover are accepted).</p>
                        <p>A Late Fee of 10% of the monthly fee will be applied to the statement for the month following the late payment.</p>
                        <p>A $10 Returned Check Fee will be assessed.</p>
                        <p>It is not Dr. Hansen-Smith's policy to deny treatment to patients if they are slightly behind in their payments. However, it is expected that
                        payment will be made in a timely manner. Occasionally a member may get behind in their payments, and a schedule of payments may be agreed upon to
                        help the member catch up. If no attempt to contact the office to arrange payments is made within 4 months of the first delinquent date, the patient
                        will be dismissed from the practice and collections will be initiated.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h4 class="sectionHeader">Cancellation Policies:</h4>
                        <p>The agreement usually renews automatically each year, but the patient or the doctor may cancel the agreement instead of continuing with the
                        patient-physician relationship in the practice.  If the patient has pre-paid the fee beyond the cancellation date, Hansen-Smith Family Medicine
                        will refund the part of the fee paid but not used, rounded-up to the next month.  Any past-due fees owed to the practice at the time that Hansen-Smith
                        Family Medicine is notified of the member's cancellation are still owed to the practice.  Hansen-Smith Family Medicine reserves the right to cancel
                        this agreement for nonpayment of fees.</p>
                        <p>Once a patient has cancelled the agreement, the doctor will assume that the patient will not return to the practice unless arranged in advance.</p>
